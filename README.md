# Fertilizer_Recommendation_System

This project is a Fertilizer Recommendation System that assists farmers in selecting the appropriate fertilizers for their crops. It takes into account various environmental and soil factors to make precise fertilizer recommendations, ultimately improving crop yield and reducing the cost of unnecessary fertilizer use

# Fertilizer Recommendation:
Fertilizer recommendation is the process of suggesting the most suitable types and quantities of fertilizers based on factors such as soil composition, temperature, humidity, moisture, and crop type. This project aims to automate this process for the benefit of farmers.

# Dataset Information
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on various agricultural factors. The dataset is structured to include the following variables:

Nitrogen: The nitrogen content in the soil.
Phosphorus: The phosphorus content in the soil.
Potassium: The potassium content in the soil.
Temperature: The temperature at the location.
Humidity: The relative humidity at the location.
Moisture: The soil moisture level.
Soil Type: The type of soil at the location.
Crop Type: The type of crop to be grown.
Fertilizer Names: The names of different types of fertilizers.

# Main Python Script using Flask
The main functionality of this project is implemented in a Python script using Flask, a web framework. The script serves as the backend for the web-based fertilizer recommendation system. It takes input from users regarding soil and environmental conditions and provides fertilizer recommendations based on the algorithm used.

To run the Flask application, make sure you have Flask installed and execute the main Python script

# Algorithm Used

The fertilizer recommendation system employs several machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and make personalized fertilizer recommendations based on specific crops and environmental conditions. The following algorithms were used:

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used to predict categorical outcomes, and it has been applied here to classify the suitability of fertilizer types for different crops and conditions.

Naive Bayes: The Naive Bayes classifier utilizes Bayes' theorem and is particularly useful for probabilistic classification. In this system, Naive Bayes aids in predicting suitable fertilizers.

Random Forest: Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. In some cases, Random Forest achieved 100% accuracy on both the training and testing sets, demonstrating its strong performance.

Decision Tree: Decision trees are used to make decisions by mapping out various options and their possible outcomes. They play a crucial role in understanding the decision-making process behind fertilizer recommendations.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a versatile algorithm used for classification tasks. It has shown excellent performance, achieving 99% accuracy in both the training and testing sets in some instances. SVM is instrumental in determining the best fertilizer for specific crop and soil conditions.

Despite the high accuracy achieved by Random Forest and SVM.
*Random Forest Classifier* is used for development of model.


# Website Development
develop a fully responsive website that serves as a user-friendly interface for our fertilizer recommendation system. The website will have two main pages:

Home Page: 
This page will provide an introduction to the fertilizer recommendation system, its benefits, and a brief overview of how it works. It will also include a user-friendly form where users can input information about their soil, environment, and crop type to receive fertilizer recommendations.

Model Page: 
The model page will display the results of the fertilizer recommendations generated by our machine learning algorithms. Users will receive personalized fertilizer suggestions based on their input.

#  Technologies Used

HTML: HTML will be used for structuring the content and creating the web pages.

CSS: CSS will be employed to style and format the web pages, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, will help in creating a responsive and mobile-friendly layout quickly.

JavaScript: JavaScript will add interactivity to the website, allowing users to submit input, receive recommendations, and interact with the system seamlessly.

Python: The primary programming language for the entire project, used for data analysis, machine learning, and web development.

NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental Python library for numerical computations, providing support for arrays and matrices. It is essential for data manipulation and mathematical operations in the recommendation system.

pandas: The pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing efficient handling of structured data such as the dataset containing agricultural information.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It is used to create various types of plots and charts to visualize data trends and model performance.

Seaborn: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It enhances the aesthetics of data visualizations in the recommendation system.

Flask: Flask is a Python web framework used to develop the user interface for the Fertilizer Recommendation System. It handles web requests and serves recommendations to users through a web-based interface
